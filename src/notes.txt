Implementing Sequential Algo
- To remove v and neighbors from G
    - Option 1: check if neighbor n for all neighbors in G
    - Option 2: remove neighbor n from all adjacency lists containing it 
        - Decided to go with option 1 for shorter runtime 
- Decide that we need 2 G's, 1 for recording original graph structure, 1 for removing vertices during implementation
    - we will call buildGraph twice to create 2 G's at the beginning
- testing did not work
    - need to compile seq_mis.cpp as well, not just main.cpp 
    - Testing commands (You can test locally with these as well):
        - "g++ -std=c++14 -o main src/main.cpp src/seq_mis.cpp"
        - "./main -seq (-f filename)"
            - "./main -seq"
            - "./main -seq -f test/random-5000.txt"
            - "./main -seq -f test/sparse-50000.txt"
- generating test cases
    - use "python3 check.py" to generate test cases
    - Test #3 cannot finish running
- pushing to Github
    - test files cannot be uploaded because they exceed size limit
    - could look into Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com
