Implementing Sequential Algo
- To remove v and neighbors from G
    - Option 1: check if neighbor n for all neighbors in G
    - Option 2: remove neighbor n from all adjacency lists containing it 
        - Decided to go with option 1 for shorter runtime 
- Decide that we need 2 G's, 1 for recording original graph structure, 1 for removing vertices during implementation
    - we will call buildGraph twice to create 2 G's at the beginning
